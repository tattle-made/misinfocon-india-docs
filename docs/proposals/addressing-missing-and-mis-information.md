Through this project, we aim to address the missing information and misinformation problems about Intersex and Asexual communities across Karnataka. This project is not limited to building an information system for communities, but ensuring the same is available and accessible in regional languages. The corpus generated, would be made public under a creative commons license. We aim to leverage free and open source, audio/video narration, annotation, and story building platforms.
