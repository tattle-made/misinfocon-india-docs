# Introduction

Anyone with an idea pertaining to any of the working groups can submit a proposal. Your proposal is an idea for a project that you would like to work on. Creating a proposal is the first step to announce your idea to the community and get feedback on it. It is also a great way to be noticed by possible collaborators. While everyone is encouraged to create proposals for anything you'd like to be seen built, its most fruitful to create proposals for projects that you'd like to be actively lead and build.

## Proposal Template

Your proposal should answer the following questions :

- **Why** do you want to initiate this project and what problem does it aim to solve? Provide some background information.
- **Who** will the final product be for, in what situations, and how will it be used? What are the target audience needs and motivations?
- **How** do you plan to address this problem? What functionalities should the final product have to meet the aforementioned usage scenarios?
- What difficulties am I currently facing? What are the milestone goals?
- What roles of collaborators are currently expected to be recruited?
- Expected project timeline?
- Which Working Group(s) do you think this proposal is best suited for

## Credit

A lot of the inspiration for activating the working groups and helping them reach fruition has been taken from the civic tech project g0v.tw from Taiwan. Weâ€™ve borrowed liberally from their [handbook](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@jothon/ctpbook_en/https%3A%2F%2Fg0v.hackmd.io%2F%40jothon%2Fctpbook_en) when apt.
